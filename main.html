"Budgeting" is simply a plan for how you will spend your money, where you list out all your income (money coming in) and expenses (money going out) over a set period of time, like a month, to ensure you're not overspending and can reach your financial goals like saving for something big or paying off debt; it's like creating a spending roadmap to manage your money effectively. </p></center>
